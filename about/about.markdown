# Why I Made This Website

I've never had a project like this, where I can utilize skills not needed in my everyday life, yet it challenges me to try something new. 
Creating a website seemed like an interesting challenge, so I began by developing one for my hockey club. Soon, I realized that a website 
for a Norwegian club aiming to attract both locals and exchange students should have a multilingual setup.

To test how a multilingual setup works, I started writing about something I know well and can describe in several languages: myself.
 This test gradually evolved into what it is todayâ€”a mix of a CV and a blog that rarely gets updated.

## How I Made the Website

A colleague and friend suggested using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and GitHub Pages to create a website. This idea lingered in the back
 of my mind when I first considered making one. I started working with it and, over the years, had some very long nights where random bursts of 
 motivation led me to work on the website, only to abandon it for the next few months before returning to it. If you're reading this text, it means
 I eventually felt comfortable enough to upload it. Perhaps that will lead to more consistent dedication.

## For Whom?

I suppose this website is for anyone who reads English, German, or Norwegian and happens to want to know something about me. **But**, I created this website
 for myself as a fun side project. If someone enjoys what I share here, that's a bonus for me.
