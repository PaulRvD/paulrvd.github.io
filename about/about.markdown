# Why I made this website?

I never had a project like this in which I can just use skills that I do not need in my everyday live that still challanges me to try something new.
Writing a website was something that could be an interesting challange. So I started writing a website for my hockey club, and soon figured that a website
for a norwegian club that wants to atract both locals and exchange students should have a multilingual setup.
To try out how a multilingual setup works I started writing about something I know quite well and can describe in several languages, myself. This test over time developed in what it is today, a mix of CV and blog rarely gets updated. 
	
## How I made the website?

A college and friend suggested to use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and github places to create a website. So I had that somewhere in the bag of my head when I first thought about trying to make one.
Started to work with it and over the years had some very long nights in which I found random motivation to work on this, to then abandon it for the next few months before coming back to it. 
If you actually can read that text, that means I at some point felt comfortable enough to upload it. Maybe that leads to me actually spending time on it more consistantly.  

## For whom?
I guess this website is for everyone who reads english, german or norwegian and happens to want to know something about me.  
**But** I made this website for myself to have a fun side project. If someone likes what I share here that is a bonus for me.
