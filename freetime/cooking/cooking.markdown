# Introduction
I am by far no professional chef, nor do I intend to create a foodblog. But I enjoy cooking and thought it is nice to create a page for some of the recepies I like. 
The recepies aren't listed in any particular order for now, but I put together a list of recepies that are available in english as well as provide links to recepies that are only available in one of the other languages at the moment.
### English Recepies
 - [Empandas](/freetime/cooking/empanadas) - a recepie form my dads childhood
 - [Pastel de Choclo](/freetime/cooking/pastel-de-choclo) - also from my dads childhood
 
### German Recepies
 - [Nudelsuppe-Käs](/freetime/cooking/nudelsuppe-kaes/de) - the recepie that made me enjoy soups
 
 - [Hänchen in Apfel-Senf-Sauce](/freetime/cooking/haehnchen-apfel-senf-sauce/de) - one of the few ways in which I eat apples
 
 - [Zimtschnecken](/freetime/cooking/cinnamon-rolls/de) - Cinnamon rolls from my childhood
 
### Norwegian Recepies
