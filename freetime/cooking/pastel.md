ingredients:
    - 4 corn cobs or 5 small cans of corn (375 g/ml each)
    - 400-500 g minced meat (beef or a mix)
    - Half a chicken
    - 2 large onions
    - 50-100 g raisins
    - 3-4 eggs, hard-boiled
    - Olives (as desired)
    - 2 tomatoes
    - Pepper, Salt, Paprika, Chili (powder or peppers, amount to taste, original recipe is spicy)
    - Cilantro leaves (optional, for garnish)
method:
    - Scrape corn from the cobs or use canned corn and puree it (some whole corn kernels can be set aside to add later).
    - Hard boil the eggs and slice or chop them roughly.
    - Sauté the minced meat and onions in a pan until cooked. Add raisins and spices to the meat mixture and cook for an additional minute.
    - In a separate pan, sauté the chicken or use pre-cooked chicken. Cut the cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces.
    - Mix the pureed and lightly salted corn with the onion-meat-raisin mixture, eggs, olives, and diced tomatoes (and washed and chopped cilantro leaves if using). If the corn mixture is too liquid, stir in some cornmeal.
    - Grease a baking dish and layer the corn mixture and chicken alternately.
    - Sprinkle the surface with some sugar and butter flakes to create a caramelized layer.
    - Bake in a preheated oven at 160°C (320°F) for 45-60 minutes. If using precooked ingredients, the pastel can be removed once it looks done, but it's best served hot.
