# Lofoten by bike

## The idea

We had a plan for this summer: Biking Trollstigen! *Trollstiegen? That is not in Lofoten why is this part of this post?*
But just after we finialised our travel route and wanted to book train tickets Trollstiegen got closed for the rest of the year so that we had to find an alternative.
That isn't espacially hard in Norway with several wounderful travel destinations and as neither of us has been to Lofoten before we decided to bike the islands.

## The plan

We were hoping to find a way to just take the ferry once, so we planned to bike from Bodø to Å, 480 km 7 days, seemed much but definetly possible, found nice resting places and basically had a schedule. Until we looked up the [Map of Norwegian tunnels](https://www.cycletourer.co.uk/maps/tunnelmap.shtml), and found out that one day of our planned route was including several long tunnel, adding up to ca. 15 km indoor biking with the occasional car passing by. 
So we instead opted for the [2 ferry option](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1688845327?share_token=aXzFJSEuqFtxXYugPDD0GWVEM5eDGsrQIkwrOxXQBDdI8fJr3j&ref=wtd) still having some of the designated campsides of the original idea in mind.  
Some time later we booked the night train and the fun begun.

## Day 0

Waiting for the train to Bodø I am nervous, what if there is a problem with the booking, *there was some confusion beforehand, but I already talked to costumer service and got the confirmation that it is all good now*, but northern lights eased the waiting at the station. Shortly after spotting them the train arrives and the conductur is expecting me with a bike, not us and our bikes, *so exactly what I talked to the customer service about*. After a bit of discussions they finally let us and the bikes on the train, I guess mostly to avoid further delay.

      Day 1 Start from Moskenes
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the night train and ferry to Moskenes the biking could start. Reflex on, bikes packed, ready to go. The day was a beautiful start of the trip, perfect weather, managable traffic, lots of fellow cyclist on the roads. With increasing distance from Moskenes the traffic slowly decreased and at times we were alone with the beautiful landscape and stunning views.
