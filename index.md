Hello!

If you found your way to this website you might already know that my name is Paul and I am originally from northern Germany.

In 2020, I moved to Norway to persue a PhD about [sea spray ice](/research). A lot of my [freetime](/freetime) I spend with fieldhockey or in nature. 
I am currently a PhD candidate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/paul.j.r.von.dohren)).
