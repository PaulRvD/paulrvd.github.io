# Hello!

If you found your way to this website you might already know that my name is Paul, and I am originally from northern Germany.
I am currently a PhD candidate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/paul.j.r.von.dohren)). 

## Where I am from

I grew up in a small town in northern Germany, where I found my passion for both science and hockey. 
However, a cabin in the woods, where I spend most of my summers, is what I think of when I think of home. This is where I fell in love with nature, had the option to explore independently, and learn a lot outside of the schooling system. 

## My studies

I couldn't decide whether I want to study chemestry or physics and was considering to do both and become a teacher afterwards. However, I heard through my hockey team about material science and decided to give it a try. 
Turns out the interdisciplinary, research-driven material science program in GÃ¶ttingen was an ideal fit. 

## What I do today

In 2020, I moved to Norway to pursue a PhD about [sea spray ice](/research). A lot of my [freetime](/freetime) I spend with fieldhockey or in nature.
