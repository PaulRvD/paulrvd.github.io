# Microspray

In the Microspray project, our goal is to understand the relation between microstructure and adhesion of sea spray icing.  

## Spray Icing
We have developed a setup that allows us to grow spray ice in a tank situated in a coldlab. Additionally, we collected samples from a buoy in Trondheimsfjorden and the port in Longyearbyen.

### Adhesion
To test the adhesion of spray ice, we designed an in-situ adhesion test specifically for use in the spray icing setup.

### Microstructure
Microstructure analysis is conducted using micro-CT and synchrotron radiation.
