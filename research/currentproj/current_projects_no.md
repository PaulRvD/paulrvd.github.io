# Microspray

In Microspray we aim to gain knowledge over the relation between microstructure and adhesion of sea spray icing.  

## Spray Icing
We were building a setup that allows to grow spray ice in a tank that is situated in a coldlab. In addition we collected samples from a buoy in Trondheimsfjorden and the port in Longyearbyen.

### Adhesion
For testing the adhesion of spray ice we designed an in-situ adhesion test that can be used in the coldlab.

### Microstructure
The microstructure is tested using micro-CT and synchrotron radiation.
